## üìä Data Collection & Preparation

1. **Data Collection:**  
   We collected a comprehensive dataset capturing various parameters influencing SMV, including:
   - Operation Type (e.g., sewing, knitting, dyeing)
   - Yarn Type (cotton, polyester, blends, etc.)
   - Machine Speed and Settings
   - Knit Construction Patterns

2. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   The raw data underwent rigorous preprocessing to ensure quality and usability. This phase involved:
   - **Cleaning:** Removing irrelevant or redundant data and addressing missing values.
   - **Encoding Categorical Variables:** Transforming categorical features into numerical formats using one-hot encoding.
   - **Scaling Numerical Features:** Normalizing numerical features to prevent biases during model training.

## üîß Modeling Techniques

To achieve our predictive goals, we employed two robust machine learning algorithms:

- **Random Forest:** An ensemble method that constructs multiple decision trees and aggregates their predictions for improved accuracy and reduced overfitting.

- **XGBoost:** A highly optimized gradient boosting framework known for its speed and performance, particularly effective in handling structured data.

Both models were trained on the same dataset, allowing for direct performance comparison.

## üìà Results & Impact

After training and testing the models, we evaluated their performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-Squared. The insights gained from this analysis enabled us to choose the best-performing model for real-time predictions.

### Deployment and Usage
The deployed SMV Prediction App is now actively utilized by our staff for:
- Real-time SMV predictions that inform production planning.
- Data-driven decisions that enhance operational efficiency.
- Streamlining labor management and cost estimation processes.

This project represents a significant advancement in our ability to utilize data effectively within our operations, fostering a culture of innovation and continuous improvement.
